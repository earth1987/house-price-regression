# House price prediction

The goal is to develop regression models to predict house prices based on their characteristics. 

**Why?**

Predicting house prices with machine learning offers benefits such as aiding real estate investment decisions, helping buyers and sellers make informed choices, assessing lending risks, analyzing market trends, and automating valuation processes.
